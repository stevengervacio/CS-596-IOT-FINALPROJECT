## Project Overview

**Door the Explorer** is an affordable, intelligent IoT-based security solution designed to detect unauthorized door access and provide real-time alerts and insightful analytics. Motivated by personal experiences with shared living spaces and the high cost of traditional security systems, our project offers a practical, cost-friendly alternative using advanced sensor fusion and cloud-based analytics.

## System Architecture

Our system follows a sophisticated multi-layered architecture:

### Sensing Layer:

* **LiDAR Sensor (TF-LUNA)**: Measures door distance.
* **Accelerometer/Gyroscope (LSM6DSO)**: Detects movement patterns.
* **Light Sensor (Photoresistor/LDR)**: Monitors environmental lighting conditions.

### Processing Layer:

* **TTGO Lily Display (ESP32)**: Performs local sensor data processing, real-time pattern recognition, and initial anomaly detection.

### Communication Layer:

* **Wi-Fi**: Secure data transmission to AWS cloud.
* **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Direct communication and monitoring through mobile devices.

### Cloud & User Interface:

* **AWS EC2 Flask Server**: Cloud backend for data storage, analytics, and real-time alerts.
* **Web-based Dashboard**: Visualizes analytics and historical data insights.

## Circuit Diagram

A top-down view of the circuit diagram is provided below:

### Pin Connections:

* **LiDAR**: UART pins (GPIO 13 RX, GPIO 15 TX)
* **Accelerometer/Gyroscope**: I2C (GPIO 21 SDA, GPIO 22 SCL)
* **Photoresistor (LDR)**: Analog input (GPIO 36)
* **Buzzer**: PWM (GPIO 26)

## Software Implementation

* **Wi-Fi & BLE Integration**: Real-time remote monitoring and control.
* **Real-Time Analytics**: Detection of abnormal activities using accelerometer and LiDAR data.
* **Email Notifications**: Instant security alerts.
* **Cloud Data Visualization**: Comprehensive AWS-hosted analytics dashboard.
* **Security Alert Levels**:

  * Level 1: Single sensor anomaly.
  * Level 2: Multiple sensors anomaly or slow door opening detected.
  * Level 3: Confirmed intrusion patterns.
